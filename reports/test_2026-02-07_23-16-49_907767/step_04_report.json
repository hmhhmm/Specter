  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI homepage with a sign-up form below. There are two main buttons visible: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. I can also see a sign-up form with email and password fields further down the page, along with a 'Next' button. As an elderly user, I need to scroll down to access the actual sign-up form since the email field (element 5) is positioned at y-coordinate 1770, which is below the current viewport.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to scroll down to see the sign-up form properly. The form elements are positioned far down the page (around y-coordinate 1770+), so I need to scroll to make them visible and accessible. This will help me see the form fields clearly with better positioning.",
