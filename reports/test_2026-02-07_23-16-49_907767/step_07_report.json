  "observation": "I can see a page for selecting your residence during the sign-up process. There's a 'Country/region' dropdown that shows 'Indonesia' is already selected (\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia). Below that, I can see a long list of countries in the dropdown with flags and names. There's a red 'Next' button at the bottom of the form. The page also shows two language selector overlays on the left and right sides of the screen with various language options.",
  "reasoning": "I notice Indonesia is already selected as the country, which is good since it's a country that should be accepted by most financial/trading platforms. As an elderly user, I want to proceed with the sign-up process. The 'Next' button is clearly visible and large enough for me to tap easily. Since the country is already selected, I should click the Next button to continue with the registration.",
