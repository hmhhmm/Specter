As an elderly user, I notice the buttons are reasonably sized and have good contrast. I need to start the sign-up process to create an account.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I want to create an account to use this trading platform. The 'Create Account' button is prominently displayed and clearly labeled, making it the obvious choice to begin the registration process. The button appears to be large enough for easy tapping.",
