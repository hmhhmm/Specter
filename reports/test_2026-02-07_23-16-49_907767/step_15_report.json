  "observation": "I can see a language selection overlay is still open, covering the main signup form. There are two language panels visible - one on the left side of the screen and another on the right side. I can see a close button (element 23) with an 'x' icon in the top right corner of the right panel. I need to close this language overlay to access the main signup form underneath. The overlay is blocking my access to the email signup form.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, these overlapping language panels are very confusing and overwhelming. I need to close this language selection overlay first before I can proceed with the email signup. I can see a close button (X icon) that should dismiss this overlay so I can access the main signup form.",
