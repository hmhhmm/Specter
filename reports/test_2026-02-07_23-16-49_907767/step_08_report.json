  "observation": "I can see a sign-up page for Deriv with multiple language selection menus open. The main sign-up form is visible with an email input field and sign-up button. I notice there are social login options (Google, Facebook, Apple) but as per instructions, I should use email signup. There's also a language selection overlay that appears to be open on the screen. As an elderly user, I should focus on the simple email signup process and dismiss any overlays first.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I need to close this language selection overlay first as it's covering the main signup form and could be confusing. I can see a close button (X icon) in the top right of the language overlay. I should tap it to get back to the simple email signup form.",
