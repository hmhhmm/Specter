  "observation": "I can see there are multiple language selection overlays open on the screen, which is blocking the main signup form. There are two language selection panels visible with search boxes and language options like English, Fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol, etc. I can see a close button (element 23) in the top-right area that should dismiss these overlays. The main signup form with email input and Sign up button is visible but partially obscured by these language overlays.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, these overlapping language selection menus are very confusing and overwhelming. I need to close these overlays first to get back to the simple signup form. I can see a close button that should dismiss these language selection panels so I can focus on the main signup task.",
