I also see language selection dropdowns on the left and right sides, and at the bottom there's a 'Sign up now' button. Since I'm in a signup flow and need to select a country, I should tap on Indonesia from the country list.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country to continue the registration process. I can clearly see Indonesia in the list at element 209, which is appropriate since previous actions showed Indonesia was being selected. This is a straightforward selection that will help me progress through the signup flow.",
