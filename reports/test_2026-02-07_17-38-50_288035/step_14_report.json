  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection dropdown is open with 'United States' already typed in the search field. There's a search input field that shows 'United States' and a clear button (\u00d7) next to it. I can also see 'No result found' text mentioned in the page context, which suggests the search isn't finding matches. I need to clear the search and select a valid country to proceed with the signup flow.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user trying to complete signup, I need to select a country/region to proceed. Since the search shows 'No result found', I should clear the current search term and try selecting from the available options or search for a different country.",
