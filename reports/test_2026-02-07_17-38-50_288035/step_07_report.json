I can also see 'No result found' message, which suggests the search isn't finding United States in the dropdown options. There are also language selection modals open on the page. I need to close these modals and focus on the main signup form.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user trying to sign up, I need to close the language selection modals first to focus on the main form. I can see a close button (\u00d7) in the top right of one of the language modals. After that, I'll need to properly select a country from the dropdown.",
