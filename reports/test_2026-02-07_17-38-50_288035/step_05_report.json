  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection form with a dropdown that is currently open. The search input field contains 'United States' and there's a clear button (\u00d7) next to it. However, I notice there are no search results showing - there's text that says 'No result found' visible in the dropdown area. I need to clear the search and look for United States in the options.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user trying to complete the sign-up flow, I need to select my country/region. The search for 'United States' isn't showing results, so I should clear the search input and try to find the correct option. I'll click the clear button (\u00d7) to reset the search.",
