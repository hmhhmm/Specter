  "observation": "I can see a country selection page for Deriv signup. The page shows 'Select your residence' with a dropdown that currently says 'Select'. There are also language selection panels open on both sides. I can see many country options available in a long scrollable list, including Indonesia, Japan, India, Brazil, Australia, and many others. There's a 'Next' button at the bottom which is likely disabled until I select a country. I need to select a country from the visible options to proceed with the signup.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country to proceed with registration. I can see many countries in the dropdown list. From my previous actions, I notice I've been trying to tap Indonesia repeatedly. Let me try a different approach and select a country that's clearly visible and likely to be accepted. Japan appears to be a good option as it's visible in the list and is typically supported by financial platforms.",
