The main form shows 'Select your residence' with a dropdown that says 'Select' and a 'Next' button below it. There are also language options displayed including English, Fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol, etc. I need to close these language modals first, then select a country from the dropdown to proceed with the sign-up.",
