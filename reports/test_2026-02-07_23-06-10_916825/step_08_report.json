  "observation": "I can see a country selection screen with a dropdown showing 'Select' placeholder and a language selection modal is open. There are two language interfaces visible - mobile and desktop versions. I can see many country options in a long list including Indonesia, Japan, Brazil, etc. The previous actions show I've been trying to select countries and close language modals. I need to first close this language modal and then select a country from the dropdown.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to close this language modal first to get to the main country selection. I can see the close button (element 23) in the top right of the modal. After that, I'll need to select a country that's likely to be accepted by this financial service.",
