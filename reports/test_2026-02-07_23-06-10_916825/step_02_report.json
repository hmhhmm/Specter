  "observation": "I can see a residence selection page with a country/region dropdown that's currently open, showing a long list of countries with flags and names. The dropdown shows many countries like Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, etc. I can see there's a 'Next' button at the bottom. From my previous actions, I selected Australia, but I need to select a different country from the visible list to proceed with the registration.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country from this long list. I can see many countries are available. Since this is a financial/trading platform, I should pick a country that's likely to be accepted. I can see Indonesia in the list (element 227) which is usually a good option for these types of platforms. The text is large enough and the country options are clearly displayed with flags, making it accessible for my age group.",
