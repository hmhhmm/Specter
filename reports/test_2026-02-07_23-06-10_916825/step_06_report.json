  "observation": "I see a country selection screen with a dropdown that shows 'Select' as placeholder. There's a long list of countries visible in what appears to be an opened dropdown (Afghanistan through Zimbabwe). I can see Indonesia, which is a good choice for this signup flow since many trading platforms restrict US/UK users. The search field at the top shows this is a searchable dropdown.",
