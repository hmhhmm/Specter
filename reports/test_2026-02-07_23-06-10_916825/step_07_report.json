  "observation": "I see a residence selection page with a country/region dropdown that appears to be open, showing a long list of countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The dropdown input field shows 'Select' as placeholder text. I can see language selection modals are open on both mobile and desktop views. I need to close these language modals first and then select a suitable country from the visible dropdown list. Looking at the previous actions, I've been trying different countries. I should pick a clearly visible country that's likely to be accepted.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to close these distracting language modals first and then select a country. I can see many countries listed including Indonesia, Japan, Australia, Germany, etc. Since previous attempts with some countries may have had issues, I'll select Australia which is clearly visible and typically accepted by financial platforms.",
