  "observation": "I see a page with 'Select your residence' at the top and a large country dropdown list. There are multiple language modal overlays open that seem to be blocking interaction. I can see language options like English, Fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol, etc. on both left and right sides of the screen. There's a country dropdown that shows 'Select' as placeholder, and I can see many country options in the list including Indonesia which I selected before. I need to close these language modals first to proceed with the country selection.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, these overlapping language modals are confusing and blocking my view of the country selection. I need to close these modal dialogs first before I can properly interact with the country dropdown. I can see close buttons for the language modals.",
