  "observation": "I can see a sign-up page with a country/region selector. The dropdown currently shows 'Select' as placeholder text. I can see a long list of countries in the dropdown that appears to be already opened, including Indonesia at element 183 which should be a good choice for this elderly user as it's likely not restricted. The Next button at element 439 is available but disabled until a country is selected.",
