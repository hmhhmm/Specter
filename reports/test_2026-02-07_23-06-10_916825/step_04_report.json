  "observation": "I can see a country selection page with a dropdown that appears to be open, showing a long list of countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The main content shows 'Select your residence' with a country/region dropdown and a red 'Next' button at the bottom. I can see many country options listed with flags and names. Looking at the previous actions, I've been repeating the action of tapping 'Indonesia country option' multiple times, which suggests I should try a different approach. I can see Indonesia is visible in the list at element 183.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country to proceed with registration. I can see Indonesia is available in the list at element 183. Since I've been repeating the same action, I should try tapping on Indonesia directly from the visible list to make my selection and move forward.",
