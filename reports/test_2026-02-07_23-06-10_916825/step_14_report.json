There's a country/region dropdown that currently shows 'Select' placeholder text, and I can see many country options in the dropdown list. There's also a red 'Next' button at the bottom and language selection modals that seem to be open on both sides of the screen. I notice I need to first close these language modals, then select a country from the dropdown.",

I should close these first to simplify the view, then proceed to select a country. I can see a close button (element 23) for the language modal on the right side.",
