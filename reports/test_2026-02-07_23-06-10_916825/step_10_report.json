  "observation": "I can see a sign-up page with two language selection modals open on the screen, and a country/region dropdown field that shows 'Select' as placeholder text. I can also see many country options listed below, including Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, and many others. There's a 'Next' button at the bottom. The previous actions show I was stuck trying to close language modals repeatedly. I need to focus on selecting a country to proceed with the sign-up flow.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select my country of residence to continue. I can see many countries listed and should pick one that's clearly visible and allowed. Indonesia is a good choice as it's visible in the list and typically not restricted by financial platforms. I'll tap on Indonesia to select it.",
