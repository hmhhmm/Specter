  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection page with 'Select your residence' text. There's a dropdown showing 'Select' placeholder, a large list of countries with flags and names (Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, etc.), and a red 'Next' button at the bottom. I also see language selection options and a 'Log in' link. This appears to be the country selection step of the signup process.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select my country of residence to proceed with the signup. I can see many countries listed, but I should select a common English-speaking country like the United States for this test. However, I don't see the US in the visible list, so I should scroll down to find it, or I could select a visible country like Australia to proceed with the flow.",
