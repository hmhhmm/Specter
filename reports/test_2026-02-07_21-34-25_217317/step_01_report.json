  "observation": "I'm on the 'Select your residence' page during the sign-up flow. I can see a country selection dropdown with 'Select' as placeholder text, and a red Next button at the bottom. There are many country options available in the dropdown list, starting with Afghanistan and going alphabetically. As a 70-year-old user, I notice the text is reasonably sized but I need to select a country before proceeding.",
  "reasoning": "I need to select a country from the dropdown to proceed with the sign-up. As an elderly user, I'll look for a common English-speaking country that would be easy to find. I can see the United States would be a good choice, but I need to scroll through the list to find it since the list is alphabetical and currently showing countries starting with A-Z.",
