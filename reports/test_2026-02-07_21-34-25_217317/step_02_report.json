There's a dropdown showing 'Select' placeholder and below it I can see a long list of countries with flags starting from Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, etc. There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom and a search field above the country list. As an elderly user, I need to select a country to proceed with the sign-up process.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select my country of residence to continue the sign-up process. I can see the United States should be in this list. Let me look for it by scrolling down since the list appears to be alphabetically ordered and I can see we're still in the 'A' countries. I should scroll down to find United States which would be near the end of the list.",
