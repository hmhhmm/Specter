Below that I can see 'No result found' which suggests the search didn't return any results. I need to clear the search and try to find United States in the dropdown options.",

Since the search for 'United States' shows 'No result found', I should clear the search input and look for the correct country option. The clear button (\u00d7) is available to reset the search.",
