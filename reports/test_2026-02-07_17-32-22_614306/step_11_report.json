  "observation": "I can see a country/region dropdown is open with 'United States' typed in the search field. There's a clear button (\u00d7) next to the search input, and the dropdown shows 'No result found' which means the search isn't finding the United States option. I need to clear the search and try a different approach or look for the United States option in the list.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user trying to complete the sign-up process, I need to select my country/region. Since the search for 'United States' is showing 'No result found', I should clear the search field and try to find the country in the dropdown list or try a different search term.",
