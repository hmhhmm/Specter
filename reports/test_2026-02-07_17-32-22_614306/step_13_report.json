  "observation": "I'm on the Deriv signup page with a country/region selection dropdown open. I can see the search input field has 'United States' entered and there's a clear (\u00d7) button. I can see a dropdown is open with search functionality, but it shows 'No result found' when searching for 'United States'. I also see language selection modals in the background. There's a 'Sign up now' button at the bottom of the form.",
  "reasoning": "I need to clear the current search and try a different approach to select United States as my country. Since the search for 'United States' shows no results, I should clear the search field and look for the correct country name format that the system recognizes.",
