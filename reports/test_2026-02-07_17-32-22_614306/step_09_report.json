  "observation": "I can see a sign-up form with a country/region selection field that has 'United States' entered in the search input. There's a clear (\u00d7) button next to the search field, and below I can see 'No result found' message, which suggests the search isn't finding United States as an option. I also notice there's a 'Sign up now' button at the bottom of the page.",
  "reasoning": "The previous attempts to search for 'United States' haven't been successful and show 'No result found'. I should clear the search input and try a different approach - maybe just selecting from the available options or trying a different search term. Let me clear the current search first.",
