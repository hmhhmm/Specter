  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection dropdown is open with a search input field that currently has 'United States' typed in it. The dropdown shows 'No result found' which means United States isn't available or there's a search issue. I can see there's a clear search button (\u00d7) next to the search field. I should clear the current search and try a different approach to select a country.",
