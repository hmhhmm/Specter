  "observation": "I see a country/region selection dropdown is open with 'United States' in the search field. There's a clear (\u00d7) button visible, and below I can see 'No result found' text, suggesting the search isn't finding the United States option. I also notice there are language selection modals open on the screen. I need to clear the search and try a different approach to select United States, or close these modals first.",
