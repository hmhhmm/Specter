  "observation": "I see the main signup page with 'Select your residence' and the country dropdown has Indonesia already selected (\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia). Indonesia shows as the currently selected country in the dropdown input field. I can see the large red 'Next' button at the bottom of the screen to proceed with the selected country. The country dropdown appears to be properly populated and ready to proceed.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I appreciate that Indonesia is already selected as my country. The Next button is clearly visible and large enough for me to tap easily. Since the country selection step appears complete with Indonesia selected, I should proceed to the next step by clicking the Next button to continue the signup process.",
