  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection page with a dropdown that shows 'Select' as placeholder text. The dropdown has been opened and is showing a long list of countries starting with Afghanistan, Albania, etc. I can see many country options with flags and names. I need to select a country that is likely to be accepted by this financial/trading platform. From the visible options, I can see Germany which should be a good choice for an elderly user.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select my country of residence. I can see the country dropdown is already open with many options visible. Germany appears to be a good choice as it's a major developed country that should be accepted by most financial platforms. I'll tap on Germany from the list.",
