I can also see there's a long list of country options available in the elements list, but the dropdown is not currently open. As an elderly user, I need to select my country of residence before proceeding.",

Since I can see many country options in the elements list (like Brazil, Australia, Japan, etc.), I should first tap the dropdown field to open it and reveal the selectable options. The dropdown currently shows 'Select' which indicates it needs to be opened.",
