  "observation": "I can see the 'Select your residence' page is now displayed. There's a Country/region dropdown with a 'Select' placeholder, and I can see many country options visible in the list below including Indonesia, India, Australia, Germany, France, Japan, etc. As an elderly user, I need to select a country that is likely to be accepted for this financial/trading platform. Based on the visible options, I should tap on a country that's commonly accepted.",
  "reasoning": "I need to select a residence country to proceed with the sign-up flow. As an elderly user, I want to pick a country that's likely to work and won't cause issues. From the visible list, I can see Indonesia is a good option as it's commonly accepted by trading platforms and is clearly visible in the list. This is better than trying to search or use the dropdown since direct selection is simpler for an elderly user.",
