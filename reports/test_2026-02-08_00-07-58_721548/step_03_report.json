  "observation": "I see a residence selection page with a dropdown for Country/region that shows 'Select' placeholder. This is part of the sign-up flow where I need to select a country. I can see there's also a dropdown open below with many country options. I notice there are many countries listed, including Indonesia which I successfully selected before. I should tap on Indonesia from the visible country list to select it as my residence.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country for my residence to proceed with sign-up. I can see Indonesia in the dropdown list at element 183, which is a good choice as it's typically allowed on trading platforms and I've used it successfully before.",
