  "observation": "I can see a sign-up page with form fields for email and password. As an elderly user, I need to scroll down to see the sign-up form properly since the email and password fields appear to be positioned very low on the page (y-coordinates around 1700-1800). I can see the email input field and password field in the elements list, but they are likely not visible in the current viewport.",

The form elements are positioned very low on the page based on their coordinates, so I need to scroll down to bring them into view where I can interact with them properly.",
