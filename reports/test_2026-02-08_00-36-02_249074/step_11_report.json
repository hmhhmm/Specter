There are also form elements further down the page with email and password fields that appear to be already filled with my test data. I can see a 'Next' button and other elements below. Since I've already filled in the email and password and clicked Next, I should look for the next step in the registration flow.",

Since I'm in a sign-up flow and have already entered my credentials, the 'Create Account' button seems like the logical next step to complete my registration.",
