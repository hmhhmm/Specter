I clicked the Next button in the previous step and the page appears to have loaded a new section, but I can only see the header area with 'Sign Up' and some buttons below. I need to scroll down to see what comes next in the registration flow, as there might be additional required fields like personal information or verification steps.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user with limited tech experience, I need to see what's next in the sign-up process. Since I've filled in the basic email and password and clicked Next, there's likely additional information required. I should scroll down to see the next part of the form or any confirmation messages.",
