  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI homepage with two main action buttons visible: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. I also notice there are form fields below (email and password inputs) that appear to be part of a sign-up form, along with a 'Next' button. Since I'm testing the sign-up flow as an elderly user, I should click the 'Create Account' button which is prominently displayed and clearly labeled for account creation.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I need clear and obvious buttons. The 'Create Account' button is large, well-labeled, and appears to be the primary action for starting the registration process. This is more appropriate than 'Get Started' which could be ambiguous.",

      "diagnosis": "The tap action was registered (evidenced by button style change and loading state) but the sign-up flow did not progress as expected. This could be due to backend connectivity issues, API failure, or frontend routing problems preventing the next step in the sign-up process.",
