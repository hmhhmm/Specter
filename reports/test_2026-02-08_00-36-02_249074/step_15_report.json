  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI homepage with a 'Sign Up' button in the header and two main action buttons - 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. Below that I can see form fields for email and password that are already filled with test data, and a 'Next' button. There's also a 'Try Again' button at the bottom. Based on my previous actions, I've been clicking various buttons but haven't made progress in the actual sign-up flow.",
