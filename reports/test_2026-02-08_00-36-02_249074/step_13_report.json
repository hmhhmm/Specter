  "observation": "I can see a Specter.AI website with multiple buttons visible. There's a 'Sign Up' button in the header, and two prominent buttons below - 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. I can also see form elements further down including email and password fields that are already filled with test data. I notice there's a 'Try Again' button at the bottom which suggests there may have been an error or failed attempt previously.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user looking to sign up, I see the main 'Sign Up' button in the header which is the most obvious entry point for registration. This appears to be the primary sign-up call-to-action and would be the logical first step to start the registration process.",
