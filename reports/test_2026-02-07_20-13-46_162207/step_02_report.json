  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection dropdown has been opened, showing a long list of countries with flags and names. I can see countries like Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, Algeria, etc. At the bottom there's a 'Sign up now' button. As an elderly user, I need to select a country to proceed with the registration. I'll select a commonly used country like the United States, but I don't see it in the current visible portion of the list. I need to scroll down to find it.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I need to find and select my country to proceed with the sign-up process. The list is quite long and I need to scroll down to find the United States or another common English-speaking country. The text is reasonably large (18px) which is good for my eyesight, and the country options have good touch targets.",

The AFTER screenshot shows a clean list without the visual annotations, but no actual scrolling movement occurred - the same countries (Afghanistan through Bahamas) are still visible in the same positions.",
    "diagnosis": "The scroll action did not produce the expected scrolling behavior. Instead of moving through the country list to show different countries or progress the sign-up flow, it only removed visual annotations while keeping the same view. This suggests the scroll functionality is not working properly or the container is not scrollable.",
