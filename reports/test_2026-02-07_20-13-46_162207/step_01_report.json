There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom. I can see many country options in a long list including Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. As an elderly user, I need to select a country to proceed with the signup process.",

Since I'm a test user, I'll select a common English-speaking country like the United States for simplicity.",
