  "observation": "I see a Deriv trading platform sign-up page with multiple signup options. There's a heading 'Join 3M+ global traders', followed by social login buttons (Google, Facebook, Apple) and an email signup section. The email input field is visible with placeholder 'name@email.com' and there's a red 'Sign up' button below it. There are also language selection dropdowns open on both sides. As an elderly user, I notice the email input field and sign-up button have good contrast and size (48px height).",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I should avoid the social login buttons as instructed and use the email signup option instead. I need to enter my email address in the clearly visible email input field. The field has good contrast and is appropriately sized for my needs.",
