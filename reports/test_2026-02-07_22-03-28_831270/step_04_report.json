  "observation": "I see the residence selection page with a country/region dropdown. I can see the dropdown field showing 'Select' placeholder and many country options are loaded in the list (Afghanistan through Zimbabwe). The dropdown appears to be opened and showing all available countries. I need to select a country that is likely to be accepted by this trading platform. Based on my previous experience with financial platforms, I should avoid restricted countries and pick one that's commonly accepted.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select my country of residence to proceed with the signup. I can see many countries listed, and I should choose one that is commonly accepted by trading platforms. Indonesia, Japan, or Germany would be good choices as they are typically not restricted. I'll select Indonesia since it was mentioned as a good option in my instructions and appears in the visible list.",
