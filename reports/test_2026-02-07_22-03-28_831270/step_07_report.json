  "observation": "I see a sign-up form for selecting residence/country. The page shows 'Select your residence' with Indonesia already selected in the dropdown (showing '\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia'). There's a 'Next' button at the bottom that appears to be the primary action to continue the registration process. The form also has language selection options visible, but the main focus should be on proceeding with the country selection.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I can see that Indonesia is already selected as my country, which is appropriate since it's one of the countries that typically works well for financial/trading platforms. The large 'Next' button is clearly visible and has good contrast. I should click this button to proceed to the next step of the registration process.",
