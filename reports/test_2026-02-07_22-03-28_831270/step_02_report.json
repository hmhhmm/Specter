  "observation": "I can see a country selection page with a dropdown list showing many countries. The dropdown appears to be open and I can see countries like Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, etc. listed with their flag emojis. There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom that appears to be the main call-to-action for proceeding once a country is selected. I notice Australia is visible in the list (element 71) which would be a good choice for an elderly user as it's a familiar country without restrictions.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country from this long list. Australia is a safe, recognizable choice that should be allowed on most platforms. I can see it clearly in the list at element 71. Selecting Australia will help me proceed with the sign-up process.",
