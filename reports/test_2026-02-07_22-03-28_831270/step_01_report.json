  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection page for Deriv. There's a dropdown showing 'Select' as placeholder text, with a long list of countries visible below it starting with Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. I need to select a country first before proceeding. As an elderly user, I can see the countries are well-formatted with flags and clear text, which is good for accessibility. I should select a country that's likely to be accepted by this financial platform.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select my country of residence to proceed with sign-up. Looking at the list, I can see many countries available. Since some financial platforms restrict certain countries, I'll select a commonly accepted one. I can see Australia in the list at element 71, which is typically accepted by most financial platforms and has good regulatory frameworks.",
