  "observation": "I see a language dropdown is open with many language options visible. There's also a sign-up form below with an email field that appears to be disabled/greyed out. I can see social login buttons and a 'Log in' link at the bottom. As an elderly user, I need to close this language dropdown first to access the main sign-up form properly.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, this open language dropdown is confusing and blocking my access to the main sign-up form. I should close it by tapping outside the dropdown or selecting English to proceed with email registration. I'll tap the English option that's already highlighted to close the dropdown.",
