  "observation": "I see a residence selection page with 'Select your residence' heading. There's a country/region dropdown that currently shows 'Indonesia' as selected. I can see the dropdown is open with a long list of countries visible, including Indonesia which appears to be currently selected (it has a 'selected' class and shows as \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia). At the bottom there's a red 'Next' button to continue. I need to proceed with the selected Indonesia and click Next to continue the signup flow.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I want to complete the signup process efficiently. Indonesia is already selected in the dropdown, which is acceptable for testing purposes. Rather than changing the country selection unnecessarily, I should proceed with the current selection by clicking the prominent 'Next' button to continue to the next step of the signup process.",
