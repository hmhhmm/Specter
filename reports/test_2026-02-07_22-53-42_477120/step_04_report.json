  "observation": "I can see the country/region dropdown is open and showing a long list of countries. The page shows various countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. I can see that Indonesia (element 209 with text '\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\udde9 Indonesia') is visible in the list. From my persona as an elderly user who needs simple interactions, I should select a country that is clearly visible and avoid trying to search. Indonesia appears to be a good option that's already visible.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country from this dropdown list. I can see Indonesia is visible in the list (element 209). This is a good choice as it's clearly visible and doesn't require scrolling or searching. I should tap directly on Indonesia to select it.",
