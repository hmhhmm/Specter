  "observation": "I can see the page has loaded after submitting the sign-up form, but there are no interactive elements visible on the current page. The URL shows 'email-verification' which suggests this is likely an email verification page where I need to check my email for a verification link. However, since I cannot see any elements or content, the page may still be loading or there might be a display issue.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I would expect to see clear instructions about what to do next after signing up. Since no elements are visible and this appears to be an email verification page, the sign-up process has likely been completed successfully and I'm now at the verification step.",
