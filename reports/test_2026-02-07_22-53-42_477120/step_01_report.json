There's a dropdown field that currently shows 'Select' placeholder, and I can see the dropdown has opened showing a very long list of countries with flags. I can see countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe listed. I need to select a country that's likely to be accepted for this financial trading platform. I can see many good options like Australia, Germany, Japan, Singapore, etc. that should work well for financial services.",

I should pick a country that's commonly accepted by financial platforms. Australia is a good choice as it's a major developed country that's typically allowed on trading platforms, and it's visible in the current list at position 71.",
