  "observation": "I can see a country selection page with 'Select your residence' heading and a dropdown/search interface. There are many country options visible in the list, including Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. I can see the search box and a long list of countries with flags and names. The 'Next' button is visible at the bottom. Since I'm an elderly user, I need to select a country that will likely be accepted by this trading platform. Looking at the visible options, I can see many countries including some good choices like Australia, Germany, Indonesia, etc.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old elderly user, I need to select a country from this long list. Since this appears to be a financial/trading platform (Deriv), I should choose a country that's likely to be accepted and not restricted. From the visible countries, I can see Indonesia which is often a good choice for trading platforms as it's typically not restricted like US/UK might be. I'll tap on Indonesia since it's clearly visible in the list.",
