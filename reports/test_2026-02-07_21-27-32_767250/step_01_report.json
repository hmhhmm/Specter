  "observation": "I can see a signup page for Deriv with a 'Select your residence' form. There's a Country/region dropdown that currently shows 'Select' as placeholder text, and a 'Next' button below it. There's also a language selector showing 'EN' and what appears to be a live chat icon in the top right. At the bottom, there's an 'Already have an account? Log in' link. I can also see a dropdown list of countries starting with Afghanistan, which suggests the country dropdown may be open or ready to be interacted with.",
  "reasoning": "As a first-time user trying to sign up, I need to select my country/region before I can proceed. The dropdown currently shows 'Select' so I need to click on it to open the country selection list and choose a country to continue with the signup process.",
