The dropdown appears to be in a search state with 'No result found' displayed, but I can see 'United States' is already typed in the search input. I need to select United States from the dropdown to proceed with the sign-up flow.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user trying to sign up, I need to complete the country selection step. I can see 'United States' is already typed in the search field, but I need to actually select it from the dropdown options. Since the dropdown shows 'No result found', I should clear the search and try again, or look for the United States option in the available results.",
