I need to start the registration process.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user looking to sign up for this trading platform, I should click on 'Create Account' as it's clearly labeled and appears to be the main call-to-action for registration. The button is large enough for me to tap easily and has good contrast.",
