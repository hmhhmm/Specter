As an elderly user, I need to scroll down to see the complete sign-up form that appears to be below the current viewport.",
  "reasoning": "I need to scroll down to see the complete sign-up form. The form elements I can see (email input, password input, Next button) appear to be positioned much lower on the page (y-coordinates around 1700-2000), so I need to scroll down to access them properly. This is the logical next step after clicking the Create Account button.",

      "diagnosis": "The scroll action failed to reveal the expected sign-up form content.
