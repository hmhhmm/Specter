  "observation": "I see a sign-up page for Deriv (a trading platform) asking me to select my residence/country. There's a dropdown menu that currently shows 'Select' as placeholder text, and I need to tap it to open the country selection. The page has large text and clear interface elements which is good for my elderly persona. I can also see some language selection overlays that seem to be open, which might be confusing.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select my country of residence to proceed with sign-up. The dropdown currently shows 'Select' which indicates I need to tap it first to see the available countries. I should focus on this main task and ignore the language overlays that seem to be open.",
