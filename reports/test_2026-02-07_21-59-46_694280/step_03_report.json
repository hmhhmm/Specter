  "observation": "I can see the signup page with a country/region dropdown that currently shows 'Algeria' as selected. There's a 'Next' button below the dropdown. I can also see there's a language selector overlay open in the background. As an elderly user, I want to proceed with the selected Algeria option and click the clear, large 'Next' button to continue the signup process.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I can see that Algeria has been successfully selected in the country dropdown. The Next button is prominently displayed with good contrast and appears to be appropriately sized. I should click it to proceed to the next step of the signup process rather than change the country selection.",
