  "observation": "I can see a country selection dropdown is now open with various country options visible. I can see Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, and Argentina listed among others. The dropdown shows many countries but as an elderly user, I need to be careful to select a country that won't be restricted. I should choose from the visible countries that are typically allowed on financial platforms. Algeria looks like a good choice from the visible options.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country from the dropdown that's now open. I can see several countries listed and Algeria appears to be a reasonable choice that's unlikely to have restrictions. The text is clear and the country options are displayed in a readable format with flags and country names.",
