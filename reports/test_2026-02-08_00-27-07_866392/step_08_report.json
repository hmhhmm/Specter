  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection page with a dropdown interface. The page shows 'Select your residence' with a dropdown that currently shows 'Select' as placeholder. There are many country options visible in the list, and at the bottom there's a red 'Next' button. I can see countries like Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. in the dropdown list. I also notice there are some language selection options at the top. I need to select a country from this dropdown to proceed with the registration.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country from this dropdown. Since many financial sites restrict certain countries, I should pick a commonly accepted country that's clearly visible in the list. I can see Indonesia is available in the list (element 183/184), which is typically accepted by most trading platforms. Let me tap on Indonesia to select it.",
