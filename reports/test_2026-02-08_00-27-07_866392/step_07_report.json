  "observation": "I can see the residence selection page with a country dropdown. The dropdown is currently open showing a long list of countries. I can see various countries like Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. and at the bottom there's a 'Next' button. The dropdown appears to be fully expanded with many country options visible. I need to select a country that is likely to be accepted by this financial services platform. Based on my previous experience with such platforms, I should choose a country that's typically not restricted.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country from this long list. Many financial platforms restrict certain countries like US, UK, etc. I can see Indonesia in the list (element 183) which is typically accepted by most trading platforms. This would be a safe choice to proceed with the registration.",
