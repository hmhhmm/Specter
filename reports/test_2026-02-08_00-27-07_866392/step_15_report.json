  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection page with a dropdown that shows 'Select' as placeholder text. The previous actions show I've been repeatedly tapping 'Indonesia country option' but I need to actually select a country. I can see there are many country options available in the list, including Indonesia (element 183/184). From the persona perspective as an elderly user, I need clear, large buttons and should avoid repetitive actions. I notice there's also a 'Next' button at the bottom that I could use to proceed once I've made a selection.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I've been stuck trying to select Indonesia repeatedly. Instead of continuing to tap the same element that hasn't worked, I should try selecting a different, clearly visible country option that appears to be working. I can see Malaysia in the list which should be a good alternative since many financial sites accept Malaysian users. Let me try tapping on a different country to break out of this repetitive cycle.",
