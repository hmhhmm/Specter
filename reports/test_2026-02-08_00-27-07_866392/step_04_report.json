  "observation": "I see a country/region selection page with a dropdown showing 'Select' as placeholder. The dropdown appears to be already open, showing a long list of countries with flags and names. I can see many country options like Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Australia, etc. I need to select a country to proceed with the sign-up. As an elderly user, I should pick a country that's clearly visible and easy to tap.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I need to select a country from this dropdown list. I can see many countries displayed. Since this is a trading/financial platform, I should avoid restricted countries like US/UK. I can see Indonesia is visible in the list (element 183), which is typically allowed on such platforms. The text is large enough and the touch target appears adequate for my needs.",
