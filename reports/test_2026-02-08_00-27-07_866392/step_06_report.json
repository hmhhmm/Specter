  "observation": "I can see this is a country/residence selection page on a Deriv sign-up flow. The page shows 'Select your residence' as the main heading with text explaining this helps show available products and services. I can see a dropdown field labeled 'Country/region' with a placeholder 'Select' and a dropdown arrow. There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom and 'Already have an account? Log in' text. I can see a long list of countries with flags and names like Albania, Algeria, Andorra, etc. The dropdown appears to be open showing all the country options.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user (70+), I need to select a residence/country to proceed with the sign-up. I can see many country options are visible in the list. Looking at the previous actions, I've been trying different countries (Australia, Indonesia, Japan) but the actions show I keep selecting the same countries repeatedly. I need to select a country that will work for this trading platform. From my knowledge of financial platforms, I should avoid restricted countries and pick one that's clearly visible and allowed. I can see Germany in the list at element 191, which is typically a good choice for trading platforms and should be unrestricted.",
