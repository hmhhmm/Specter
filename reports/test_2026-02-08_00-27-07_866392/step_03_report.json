  "observation": "I see a country selection page for sign-up with a dropdown that shows 'Select' and is currently opened showing a long list of countries. I can see many countries like Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. at the top of the list. As an elderly user, I need to select a country that will work for this financial service. I should avoid restricted countries like US/UK and pick a visible option from the list.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I need to select a country from this dropdown. I can see many countries listed and should pick one that's commonly accepted. Indonesia was already selected in previous steps, so I'll select a different country that's visible and likely to be accepted - Japan is a good choice as it's visible in the list and generally accepted by financial services.",
