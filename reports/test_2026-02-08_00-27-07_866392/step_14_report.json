There's a search field visible and a long list of countries including Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. I need to select a country from this dropdown. I can see many countries listed, and I should choose one that's likely to be accepted by the trading platform. Looking at the visible countries, I can see Indonesia is listed (element 183), which should be a good choice as it's typically allowed on trading platforms.",
