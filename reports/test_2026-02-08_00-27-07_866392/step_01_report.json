I can see countries like Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, etc. with their flag emojis. There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom that appears to be the main action button to proceed. As an elderly user, I need to select a country that will work for this trading platform.",
  "reasoning": "I need to select a country from the dropdown list. As an elderly user, I want to pick a country that's likely to be accepted by this trading platform. I can see many countries listed, and I should choose one that's commonly accepted. Australia appears in the list and is usually a good choice for financial services. Let me tap on Australia from the visible options.",
