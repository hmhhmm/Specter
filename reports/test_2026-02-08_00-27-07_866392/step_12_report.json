  "observation": "I can see a country selection page with 'Select your residence' as the title. There's a country dropdown that shows 'Select' as placeholder text, and below it is a long scrollable list of countries with flags and names. I can see many countries listed from Albania to Zimbabwe. There's also a 'Next' button at the bottom that appears to be disabled until a country is selected. As an elderly user, I need to select a country from this extensive list.",
  "reasoning": "I need to select a country to proceed with the registration. Looking at the available countries, I can see many options including Indonesia, Australia, Germany, Japan, and others. Since I'm an elderly user who may find long lists challenging, I'll choose a country that's easily visible and commonly accepted. I can see Germany (\ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea) in the list at element 191, which would be a good choice as it's typically well-supported by international services.",
