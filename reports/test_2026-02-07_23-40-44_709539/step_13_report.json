  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI website with two prominent buttons visible: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. I've already completed the email and password input steps in the signup flow, and the previous 'Create Account' button tap was successful. The buttons appear to be reasonably sized for my elderly persona, though I'd prefer them to be larger for easier tapping.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I want to continue with the account creation process. Since I already tapped 'Create Account' in the previous step and it was successful, I should now tap 'Get Started' to proceed to the next phase of the signup process. This seems like the logical next step in the registration flow.",
