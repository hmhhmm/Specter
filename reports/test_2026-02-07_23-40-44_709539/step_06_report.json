I can also see there are form elements further down the page (email input, password input, and Next button) but they appear to be quite far down based on their y-coordinates. As an elderly user, I need to access the signup form, and since scrolling failed in previous attempts, I should try clicking the 'Create Account' button which might navigate me to a proper signup page.",
