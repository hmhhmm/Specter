  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI homepage with two prominent action buttons: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. Below that, there appears to be a signup form with email and password fields that are already filled in (ai.test.user@example.com and SecurePass123!), along with a 'Next' button. There's also a 'Try Again' button at the bottom. Since I've already clicked the Create Account and Get Started buttons in previous steps, and the form appears to be filled out, I should click the Next button to proceed with the signup process.",
  "reasoning": "As an elderly user, I can see the form is already filled with the test credentials. The Next button is clearly visible and appears to be the logical next step to continue the signup process. The button is large enough and has good contrast for my needs.",
