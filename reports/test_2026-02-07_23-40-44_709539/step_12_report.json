  "observation": "I can see a Specter.AI page with multiple buttons and form elements. I notice there are two main action buttons visible: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started'. I also see form elements below (email and password fields) that already have my test data filled in from previous steps. There's a 'Next' button and a 'Try Again' button at the bottom. Since I'm in a signup flow and have already filled the form, I should click the 'Create Account' button to proceed with registration.",
