  "observation": "I can see a page with Specter.AI branding and several buttons. There are two main buttons visible: 'Create Account' and 'Get Started', along with a 'Sign Up' button in the header. I can also see there are form elements below (email and password fields) but they're positioned very low on the page (y-coordinates around 1700-2000). As an elderly user, I need to scroll down to access the actual signup form fields.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user with limited tech experience, I see the 'Create Account' button is prominently displayed and seems like the logical next step to begin the registration process. The form fields are below the visible area, so I should click this button first to potentially navigate to or reveal the signup form.",
