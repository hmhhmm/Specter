  "observation": "I can see the Specter.AI homepage with a 'Sign Up' button in the header and a 'Create Account' button that appears to be part of a call-to-action section. I can also see that there are form elements (email and password fields) further down the page that I need to scroll to access, as indicated by their high y-coordinates (1700+). The previous scroll attempt failed, so I should try clicking the 'Create Account' button first to see if it navigates to a signup form.",
  "reasoning": "As a normal user wanting to sign up, I see a prominent 'Create Account' button on the current view. This is likely the main path to start the registration process. I should click this button to proceed with signup rather than trying to scroll to form elements that might not be accessible yet.",
