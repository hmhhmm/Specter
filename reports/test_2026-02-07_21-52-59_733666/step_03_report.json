  "observation": "I can see a country/region selection dropdown that is already open and showing a search input field with 'United States' typed in it. Below the search field, there's a message 'No result found', which means the search didn't return any results. I can also see there's a clear button (\u00d7) next to the search field. As an elderly user, I should try clearing the search and look for United States in a different way, or select a visible country option.",
