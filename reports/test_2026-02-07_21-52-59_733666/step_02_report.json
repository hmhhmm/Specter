  "observation": "I see a country selection dropdown is open with a list of countries visible. I can see Afghanistan, Aland Islands, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, and Argentina in the visible options. There's also a search input field at the top of the dropdown. As an elderly user, I should select a common country like the United States, but I need to either search for it or scroll to find it in the list.",
  "reasoning": "As a 70-year-old user, I want to select a familiar country like the United States. The dropdown is open but I can only see countries starting with 'A'. I should use the search function to quickly find 'United States' rather than trying to scroll through the entire alphabetical list, which would be easier and faster for someone with limited tech experience.",
